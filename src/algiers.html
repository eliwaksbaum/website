      <h1>Algiers</h1>
      <p class="intro">I originally made this game inspired by The Stranger in high school, but it didn't work so well and I've wanted to 
        revisit it ever since. I finally got around to it, and I ended up making a pretty neat tool for writing parser-based 
        interactive fiction with C# in the process. 
        Read more about how I made it <a href="/projects/%path()/notes/">here</a>. 
        <!--You can also download this game and play it locally in your console <a>here</a>-->
