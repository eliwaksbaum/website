<p>As I write this in March 2021, it's been almost a year since I started working with Unity. Nobody quite knew what
    we were getting into at the time, and online companies were making a big show of offering their services for free
    to give people something to do for the few weeks or months (surely it wouldn't be longer than that, right??) we were
    all stuck at home. So when Adam Bohn (aka <a target="_blank"href="https://www.artix.com">Artix Krieger</a>, aka the creator of my <a target="_blank"href="https://www.dragonfable.com">favorite game of all time</a>, aka the
    reason I'm interested in game development at all) tweeted that Harvard was offering courses on the edX platform, I thought
    I'd take a look. There I found Colton Ogden's "CS50's Introduction to Game Development" course. It seemed absolutely perfect,
    and I dove into the lectures. I quickly realized, though, that I wasn't so interested in making games in LOVE2D (no offense).
    I really liked the idea of recreating iconic games as a way to learn, though, so I decided I would follow along in Unity.
    I gave myself a quick Unity crashcourse (I highly recommend <a target="_blank"href="https://learn.unity.com/project/ruby-s-2d-rpg">this</a> tutorial for getting to know Unity's 2D features and <a target="_blank"href="https://learn.unity.com/project/beginner-gameplay-scripting">these</a> 
    <a target="_blank"href="https://learn.unity.com/project/intermediate-gameplay-scripting">two</a> for a good C# primer) and then returned to lesson 1: Pong.</p>

<p>Sure, using Unity to make Pong is a little like using a cast iron skillet to make cereal, but making even a simple game is very complicated for a beginner
    and I didn't want to bite off more than I could chew. Yes, this way you lose the chance to dig your hands into the guts of update loops, AABB collisions,
    and calculating all your velocities, but I had a look at that stuff back in my Flash (I mean, Animate) days and I feel like I had a good enough understanding
    to start using a higher level tool. I think I did ok for a first stab, though a year later I definitely have changes I would make.
    Since I didn't take notes at the time, I thought I'd just open up the project, scroll through the code,
    and write what I think.</p>
    
<p>There are only five scripts here, and two do most of the heavy lifting, so let's just run through each of them. SoundEffect is my favorite. It does one
    thing (play a sound on a collision) and it does it well, executing a unique behaviour on multiple GameObjects: A+. Next come Ball and ScoreBox, and both are also pretty simple: Satisfactory.
    MessageBoard and Paddle, though, are a little more bloated. Here are the things that most itch at me to be changed, looking at them now.</p>

<h3>MessageBoard:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>There's a string called currentstate, but it's only ever set as "serve" or "play", so it should really be a boolean called isServing.</li>
    <li>I've got an else if block that should probably be a switch statement. Maybe I didn't know about switch yet, but I did it fine in the Ball scipt.</li>
    <li>Most distressing, is the fact that this script is
        responsible for removing the instructions text boxes that appear when you start the game. The Message Board and those instructions relate only in that they both
        display text. There's no reason not to have a seperate component that hides the text when the player presses Enter for the first time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Paddle:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>It looks like I was too lazy to get the camera bounds in the part that prevents the paddles from exiting the screen, which would break if I ever decided
        to resize the view. Unity really should make it easier to get the extents of the screen, though. I think AS3's stage object is what I miss most from Flash.</li>
    <li>There was some game-breaking stuff happening in the ball-paddle collision that I had to fix, but I left the old version as comments. What's there now still isn't perfect
        and it illustrates the drawback of using Unity for 2D games like this. There's a very powerful
        and realistic physics engine at my disposal, but I hardly ever want purely realistic physics. Making things move how I want is definitely what I get most 
        stuck on and frustrated over in Unity. Here the issue is that with purely realistic bounces, it's possible to get stuck with the ball moving in a straight line between
        the paddles, which is boring. The old solution was to add a random vertical force, multiplied by a bounce scaler (even though the ball's material is already bouncy), but that really
        messed with how the ball moved. Without spending too much time on it, I instead made it so the vertical velocity is adjusted directly a little on each bounce, 
        so any flat bounce loops shouldn't last more than a few hits.</li>
    <li>If you stomach it out to 10 points, you'll see the little dance they do! Not something I'd change, I just wanted to include a coroutine since it was one of the topics
        in the intermediate C# tutorial I was using.</li>
    <li>Displaying the score should probably be another component's job. The GameObject with the text could do it itself, getting the score either from the paddles
        or a ScriptableObject they both are looking at.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it I think. Very weird emotions knowing it's been a year. I feel like I do know much more about working in Unity and C# than I did a year ago,
    but also wish I'd spent more of my ample free time in 2020 on it, learning even more. Well, onwards and upwards I guess.
