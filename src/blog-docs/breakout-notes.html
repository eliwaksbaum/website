<p>
Breakout, or as I knew it, Brick Breaker, used to be my favorite video game. It was about the only video game I knew for 
a time, and I would play for hours on my dad's Blackberry phone with a physical keyboard and scroll-wheel. So I was pretty 
excited to see it was the third game in the CS50G curriculum. I started working on it about a year ago, right after finishing 
Pong and Flappy Bird. I left it half-way done at the time, though, so while I just had to do some touch-ups for the other 
two, a good amount of this game was built in the month before writing. It's the biggest game I've made so far, and I think 
it will be the last one I'll take out of CS50G's playbook before thinking up my own projects.
</p>
<p>
I feel like at this point I have the experience and knowledge required to start making my own games, and while 
obviously I could learn a lot more from the rest of the lectures in the class, I'd rather venture out on my own. You could 
also argue that I already did that with this project, since if you look at CS50G's version of Breakout and the techniques 
students are supposed to learn from it, you'll see what I've done diverges quite a bit. Most flagrantly, the course uses 
Breakout as an example of how to implement random level generation, but I took the alternate route of exploring deliberate 
level design.
</p>

<h2>Game Design</h2>
<p>
Compared to Pong and Flappy Bird, Breakout required a lot of Game Design, by which I mean everything that's involved in 
making a game outside of its code. I tried to make each level unique and visually interesting, and to have each one 
introduce a new concept or challenge. The goal was ten levels that didn't feel repetetive and that ramped up the difficulty 
in a natural progression. Because I did want this game to be difficult; if I did it right you won't get too far without 
really focusing. And that's because I want this game to actually be fun to play. I wanted the player to feel some drama 
and excitement in actually losing lives, reaching unlock milestones, and chasing down the ball or an elusive 1-up.
</p>
<p>
How the player feels while playing is of course also affected by the rest of the game's design: the art, sound, music, 
lighting, animation etc. Thankfully, Breakout being a 2D arcade game, I could get away with just some basic vector art 
and 16-bit sound effects, which I did create myself (and which took me long enough to wonder how more involved games 
ever get made). I did the art in <a target="_blank" href="https://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a>, a neat, open source Illustrator alternative, and made the sounds with 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bfxr.net">Bfxr</a>. I'm very pleased with how it all turned out and think the highlights on the blocks and the physical thud 
of the ball hitting the paddle greatly elevate the game. Most of what I've been working on, though, was diving back into 
the code and fixing it all up.
</p>

<h2>Reacquainting</h2>
<p>
Stepping back into the project after about a year was actually not too bad. I could definitely stand to comment more, 
but I think I did a pretty good job from the start with decoupling. That made it so I didn't have to wade through any huge webs 
of interconnected classes, trying to piece together how a simple result was acheived in the code. I was able to fix bugs and add 
features without having to first understand how the whole project worked. Systems were well contained, and some like loading 
levels or saving data I didn’t need to touch at all (until I eventually had to totally redesign them later). The one thing that did 
require a lot of cross-referencing between classes was the way I was using Scriptable Objects.
</p>

<h2>The Scriptable Object</h2>
<p>
Most classes that you’ll write in Unity are MonoBehaviours, i.e. components that will be attached to 
GameObjects which live in a scene. Scriptable Objects, however, function independently from GameObjects 
and live in your Assets folder. Components can reference them by exposing a public field of type [MyScriptableObjectClass], 
into which you can drag a Scriptable Object instance in the Editor. They can be very useful, and I recommend watching 
two Unite conference talks by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vmRwLYWNRo">Richard Fine</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk">Ryan Hipple</a> which are responsible for the Scriptable 
Object architecture I used for Breakout.
</p>
<p>
There are three main ways I use Scriptable Objects in the game. The first is to store what I’ll call static data, constants that are set before 
the game starts, things like speeds, max healths, or lists of sprites. That’s what the BrickData, PaddlesData, PaddleSizes, and 
PowerData classes are. So instead of each instance of the Power class having its own speed field set to the same value, they 
all reference the same Scriptable Object with a single speed field. This also makes testing and balancing much easier, since 
changes to Scriptable Objects made in play mode persist, unlike those made to MonoBehaviours. Whereas before I could fiddle 
for ten minutes with parameters only to forget what the final value I settled on was once I left play mode, now that final value just 
stays.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes the data I want to store is just a single field, though. That’s where the Value classes come in. BoolValue, IntValue, 
FloatValue, and SpriteValue all contain just one field: Value. So instead of storing the paddle’s speed in a float field, I do it in 
a FloatValue field. That doesn’t sound all that exciting, but these Value classes are at the heart of my second main use of Scriptable 
Objects: storing dynamic data, things that are going to change throughout the game like a player’s health or score. These are 
values that lots of different classes need to access. Instead of using a globally accessible singleton, the data they need can be handed to 
them through the Unity Editor. So when the ball exits the screen, the BallExit class modifies the health IntValue, which the HealthDisplay 
class is looking at to update the number of hearts displayed on the screen. BallExit and HealthDisplay don’t ever know about each other, 
they just have references to the same IntValue object. This also helps with testing, because if I’m not doing well, I can set health back 
to 3 in the Inspector to keep going, and I’ll see the hearts pop back up by themselves.
</p>
<p>
Those two main uses, storing static and dynamic data, are well outlined in Fine’s and Hipple’s talks, and I was really happy 
with what I was able to do with them for Breakout. But then I had an idea. What if the Value I was storing in my Scriptable 
Object wasn’t a float or a bool, but a function?
</p>

<h2>Callables</h2>
<p>
So I made the Callable class. Instead of a single field called Value, it has a single method called Call. Now I could pass around 
references to Callable objects, and therefore to the methods they contained. Sounds great, but it led to my reinventing 
functionality that already exists within Unity and even C# itself.
</p>

<h3>The Game Event</h3>
<p>
I think the silliest thing that my Scriptable Object zeal lead me to was the GameEvent class. It holds a reference to an Action 
(a delegate with no parameters that returns void) and has methods for subscribing to and unsubscribing from that Action. 
It extends Callable, and its Call method calls the Action. If that sounds like a clumsy, useless alternative to a C# public static 
event, that’s because it is. I made three instances of the GameEvent class, and two of them are only ever called by one class. 
So I was constantly dragging these objects through the Editor so that the classes who needed a reference to these delegates 
could have them, essentially for no reason at all. There is the case of ServeEvent, which is triggered by two different classes, 
(BallExit when a ball leaves the screen and LevelLoader when a new level starts) a behavior that a public static event could 
not emulate. But I’m sure that could be accomplished another way, and does not defend the use of GameEvent.
</p>

<h3>Buttons</h3>
<p>
Besides the GameEvent class, I mostly used Callables for buttons. If you take a look at the buttons in the game, you’ll see 
that I inexplicably created my own class, GameButton, that copies what the built-in Unity UIButton does. Except Unity’s button 
doesn’t need the method that the button calls to be stored in a Callable Scriptable Object. It can call any method on any class in 
the scene or in the Assets folder. That functionality would have made the buttons in the paddle selector scene so much cleaner 
than what I ended up doing, which involved manually checking for the user’s click and having the buttons and the paddle 
displayer hold references to each other.
</p>
<p>
For methods that don’t live on GameObjects in the scene, though, I think Scriptable Objects might actually present a 
good solution. Some buttons in the game load levels or change scenes. It doesn’t make a ton of sense for the classes that 
do those actions to be MonoBehaviours, attached to empty GameObjects. Using a Scriptable Object means that you can place a 
button into your scene, drag over the reference to the object, and you’re done. No need to add a whole another GameObject to 
the scene to hold that method. Also, a Scriptable Object can hold references to audio or prefabs, where with a MonoBehaviour, 
you’d have to drag in those references for each instance.
</p>

<h3>The Level Loader</h3>
<p>
The LevelLoader class is one of the Callables I think I would keep for buttons to reference. It holds references 
to all the level prefabs, and as a MonoBehaviour it would have to be added to multiple scenes. It took a while for 
the LevelLoader to arrive at its current incarnation, though.
</p>
<p>
At first glance, the idea of storing levels as prefabs and having a whole class responsible for loading and destroying 
those prefabs looks like I’m reinventing the wheel again. Why not just have multiple level scenes? I probably could 
have figured out how to do it with separate scenes, but I like this way better. There are a lot of things that I want 
to persist between levels (the paddle, the ball, health display, score display, and more). I could use DontDestroyOnLoad, 
but then I’d have to differentiate between loading a level scene, when the player beats a level, or another scene, when the 
player loses all their lives or beats the tenth level. Checking the scene’s name for the sub-string “level” seemed janky. I think 
my system is more elegant, and makes it easier to edit and swap around levels on the fly.
</p>
<p>
I initially planned on loading these level prefabs using Addressable Assets, but once I started actually building to WebGL, 
I ran into some big problems. Namely, that I do not understand how Addressable Assets work at all. I really tried to  
get it working, but eventually decided faster loading times couldn’t be worth the suffering (though now that I see 
how long loading really does take, I’m reconsidering a little). But abandoning Addressable Assets gave me a big problem: How 
do I store references to the level prefabs? The LevelLoader class at that point was just a bunch of public static methods and 
couldn’t interact with anything in the Editor.
</p>
<p>
This was one of the last problems I was trying to fix, and desperately wanting to wrap up the project, I turned to the unsavory 
possibility of making the LevelLoader a singleton. Before I gave in, though, I consulted <a target="_blank" href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html">Game Programming Patterns</a> 
to see what wisdom Bob Nystrom could offer. In the chapter on singletons, he mentions that potential singletons are often 
unnecessary managers, doing tasks that the “managed” objects would be better off doing themselves. This turned out to be 
true in my case; only one class was ever calling the public static methods of the LevelLoader. A bit of re-configuring, and 
the LevelLoader became a Scriptable Object with a public GameObject array to store the level prefabs and a Call method for 
the buttons.
</p>

<h2>Messing with Reality</h2>
<p>
The last thing I want to talk about is my continued frustration with making things move how I want them to. A Breakout game with 
realistic, physics-bound bounces would be a disaster. If the ball’s angle gets too shallow, it gets stuck traveling back and forth across 
the screen for minutes. The ball can get trapped between a block and the ceiling forever; it can somehow lose all of its momentum 
by hitting two bricks at once, it can do all sorts of things that I wish it would not. So I slapped BadAngleFixers and ZeroXFixers 
everywhere, and I’m hoping that’s enough to keep the ball moving in a productive way. But I’m left thinking that there’s got to be a better way to 
do this than to employ a sophisticated physics engine and then clumsily tamper with it. If you know of one, please let me know.
</p>

<p>
And so, over a year after first finding the CS50G course, I finally finish my journey with it. The first three lectures of it, anyhow. 
The general spirit of those first three lectures, anyhow. And regardless of how faithfully I followed the material, it did inspire me 
to give learning Unity another chance, to seek out other great resources, and to explore making games again. So thank you very 
much, Colton Ogden and edX for that, and for whatever comes next.
